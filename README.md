# DataVizSouthBend

Overview

Working with your team, you are to design a dashboard visualization for the Mayor of South Bend. It should interact with one or more of the data sets in a way that provides insights into the data and inform decisions the Mayor must make.

Background

The Mayor would like to understand more about how disparate South Bend civic data sets interact with each other. Your team has been asked to prepare a presentation to the Mayor for the purposes of demonstrating your dashboard.

The Data

Below is a list of slightly modified data sets from the City of South Bendâ€™s Open Data Portal. Access these data sets on Github. If you would like to use any other data sets for your final project, please check with your instructor.

311 calls
Census data
Business licenses
Code enforcement cases
City council districts
Public facilities
Schools
Parks
Abandoned properties
Location of street lights


The Audience

Your team will be presenting your dashboard data visualization to the Mayor using South Bend civic data sets. This could be like the use case we saw in the intro videos, but you are not limited to those data.
